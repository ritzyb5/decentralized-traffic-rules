# decentralized-traffic-rules
Currently, traffic rules are implemented by police.
This requires citizens to trust that a central authority will fairly
enforce the rules. With the advent of IoT and Smart Cities,
it is possible to leverage this infrastructure to decentralize the
detection and penalization of speeding violations, mitigating the
need for law enforcement officials. Here we propose a concept for
a smart contract pertaining to the enforcement and regulation
of speeding laws.
